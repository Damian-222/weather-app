Hello possible employers, I had to create a brand new Github accound due to my computer with all my computer generated passwords being stolen at the airport :( 
But I am steadfastidly working on new projects to showcase my experience. I have about 5 of experience with javascript and css and about 1.5 years of experience with APIs 
I made this simple and quite boring weather app just to showcase API experience with the help of youtube videos and google :)
